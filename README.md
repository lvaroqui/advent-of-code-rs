# Advent of Code - Rust

My solutions to (some) days of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

# TODOs

- import 2021
- remove old repos from github and rename this one
- fill README
- check solution against AoC (with cache to avoid spamming the site)?
- prompt before file gen
